                This research project led by Dr. Ning Zeng focuses on measuring CO2, PPM2.5, temperature, and humidity indoors and outdoors on and around the
                University of Maryland College Park campus through sensors. High levels of CO2 can impact both the infrastructure and personnels in an environment.
                To the prevent spread of infectious diseases, improve energy efficiency, and increase ventilation, our research hopes to enlighten college students
                and university facilities to act and react to the changing indoor climate. These sensors will actively collect
                data about the environment in lecture halls or hallways and stored into an easily managable online database that is publicly available. This data can
                help personnel around campus make informed decisions about how to implement future university projects.
            </p>

            <p style= "font-size: small;">
                * Analyzed data on the sense.umd.edu website to determine causes of high level of CO2 at the University of Maryland and other environments <br>
                * Effectively led a team to write grant proposals to the office of sustainability to support the research teamâ€™s goals

            <b>Quantifying the Role that Disaster Aid has on Communities</b> <br>

            <p style= "font-size: small;"> 
                This research project led by Dr. Allison Reilly focuses on determining the role that disaster aid has on communities. When major disasters such as
                hurricanes or fires occur, state governments can seek federal aid to help repair or mitigate costs. However, major discrepancies can occur when federal aid
                is given to states or local communities. Unfair distribution of money or inaccurate evaluation of costs can occur. We are evaluating what impact this 
                has on communities economically and socially.
            </p>

            <p style= "font-size: small;"> 
                * Analyzed data provided by NOAA, HUD, and SHELDUS to determine how disaster aid was/is allocated to various states and counties<br>
                * Cleaned various datasets that had thousands of entries so they could be manipulated and analyzed effectively

                My personal interest in aerospace engineering brought me to work at Adcole Maryland Aerospace Inc. I made model airplaces made out of balsa wood powered
                by rubber bands as a hobby throughout high school. I would compete in competitions for flight time and overall enjoyed working alongside mentors such as Randy
                Kleinert to learn and improve. Through connections, I was able to work at this amazing company and learned how to program and apply my aerospace knowledge in
                the industry.

                I got hired for this role by Dr. Nicole Mogul because of my exceptional performance in a science communication discussion class. The purpose of this project
                was to help the incoming class of 2024 acclimate to the online environment. I helped with course material, discussions, and improving the overall
                learning for students.

## General-Info
This is a hub for my own personalized website information. This is meant for employers and those who want a sneak peak at who I am. There are(will) multiple pages within the website to help convey my research experience, work experience, personal projects, references, and other information about me. 


## Languages
Project is created with:
* HTML


## Setup
The personal website is hosted by University of Maryland, College Park's umd.edu domain and on
my personal repository. Navigate to google chrome(or some other web browser) and paste this on to the
search bar and press enter. Otherwise just pull it into your local repository and open it in chrome.

## Pages
* [2021_Tam_Portfolio.html](#main-page)

### 2021_Tam_Portfolio.html
This is the main webpage with navigation links to programs I am in. Furthermore, there is more elaboration on my work, research, school, and personal experience than what is apparent on my resume. 

## Status
Currently a work in progress. Needs navigation links to other webpages that have more specialized details. Stylistic details are needed.

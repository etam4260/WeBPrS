                    The psychology program here at the University of Maryland, College Park has taught Emmet the research and soft skills
                    needed to succeed in academia and the workplace. The computer science program often lacks teamwork and research skills that 
                    are crucial in educational and societal growth. He has learned a variety of tools used by researchers alike such as R, Python, JASP,
                    and Excel for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. He hopes to use these skills and abilities to help connect to friends and
                    coworkers throughout his life and career.
